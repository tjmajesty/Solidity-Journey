# Solidity-Journey
### Purpose

A part of repositories to track my sojourn in Ethereum land focusing particularly on attempts at learning the Solidity (official language of Ethereum land). This repository is particularly important for the purposes of: 

(a) monitoring progress;

(b) assessing feedback; and above all 

(c) keeping my sanity:wink:.
